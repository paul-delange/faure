Thereís a biological reason why your summer six-pack is buried under winterís spare tyre. Studies by researchers at Indiana University have found that men pile on a minimum of one kilogram over winter because cold weather makes you want to eat more. Unfortunately for you, a US study by Duke University showed that gaining weight kills libido and makes men and women less sexually adventurous.

***The solution***
Boost levels of happiness and sex hormones with pizza. Studies published in medical journal The Lancet have shown that levels of mood-boosting chemical serotonin are lowest in winter and highest on bright, sunny days. However, according to University of North Carolina studies, itís possible to replicate the summer serotonin boost by eating smarter. The scientists found that serotonin is manufactured from protein-rich foods and its release is triggered by carbohydrates. And that smells to us like a meat-feast pizza.

9,Different condoms,"A condom is the only way to effectively protect against transmission of HIV or an STI during unprotected sex.
The elasticity of a condom allows it to adapt to all morphologies.

More on this subject:

* Latex: very resilient and resistant, even at very low thickness.
It deteriorates when exposed to cold, heat, sunlight and with time.

* Polyurethane: Tips for people who are allergic to latex.
It is less resistant than latex. Therefore change it more often during sex and use more lubricant.

* Hypoallergenic; the latex is a specially treated to remove components responsible for allergies.

* Textured: ribbed, striped and others designed to improve the sensations.

Several sizes:

* Length: between 15 cm and 20 cm, the standard size is 17 cm.

* Width: 40 mm and 60 mm, the standard size is 52 mm.

* Thickness: the finest is 0.02 mm and 0.08 mm thicker, but for most the thickness is 0.03 mm.

It is important when buying condoms to check the exact dimensions as the value of sizes can vary from one brand to another.

Lubricated or not: 

Condoms are usually lubricated, it can facilitate the process but always add gel when use.
Putting the gel reduces the risk of tearing the condom.
If a condom is not lubricated, it should be lubricated before use unless it is for oral sex.

The Femidom

it is designed for vaginal penetration. It is a polyurethane sheath that is larger than the condom but less elastic.

11,How to know him better?,"***Penis*** 

The penis (shaft) and scrotum (balls) are the external sexual organs of men. 
The organ of copulation and urination in the male; formed of three columns of erectile tissue, two arranged laterally on the dorsum (corpora cavernosa penis) and one median ventrally the urethra traverses the latter; the extremity (glans penis) is formed by an expansion of the corpus spongiosum and is more or less completely covered by a free fold of skin (prepuce).	


***Testes, Testicles***

The male sexual glands, the two testes within the scrotum produce sperm and testosterone. Within each testis is a kilometer of ducts called the seminiferous tubules, the organs which generate sperm. Each testicle produces nearly 150 million sperm every 24 hours. 
	
***Monorchide***

Males have only one testicle, But This will not effect at all during sexual intercourse or fertility.

* a lump in one testis which may or may not be painful 
* sharp pain or a dull ache in the lower abdomen or scrotum
* a feeling often described as ""heaviness"" in the scrotum



***Hydrocele***

Is a collection of fluid in the scrotum, the sac that holds the testicles. There are two types of hydroceles depending on how they form. One type, seen shortly after birth, is called congenital hydrocele. In adults, hydroceles develop slowly due to a variety of causes. The condition may occur in one or both sides. Although typically painless, hydroceles may be caused by infection, which may cause pain or discomfort


***Elephantiasis***

Elephantiasis is a disease characterised by inflammation of the fibrous connective tissue, leading to excessive swelling of the leg, scrotum, arm or breast and more rarely other parts of the body. It is caused by the parasitic worm Filaria which blocks the lymph vessels, and at the same time causes irritation of the skin.	
	

***Testicular torsion*** 

Is a disorder in which the testicles rotate (twist) and strangle the spermatic cord, which consists of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the duct that carries sperm from the body, cutting off the blood supply to the testicles. Torsion can cause shrinkage and tissue death, and may require surgical removal of the testicles if not treated promptly. Torsion often occurs during sleep.
	

***The Prostate***

Is an organ forming part of the male reproductive system. It is located immediately below the bladder and just in front of the bowel. Its main function is to produce fluid which protects and enriches sperm. In younger men the prostate is about the size of a walnut.

11,How to know her better?,"***The vulva***

Is the external genital organs of the female .The vulva has a sexual function; these external organs are richly innervated and provide pleasure when properly stimulated


***Mons Veneris***

The mons veneris, Latin for ""hill of Venus"" (Roman Goddess of love) is the pad of fatty tissue that covers the pubic bone below the abdomen but above the labia. The mons is sexually sensitive in some women and protects the pubic bone from the impact of sexual intercourse. 


***Clitoris***

The clitoris, is the small white oval between the top of the labia minora and the clitoral hood, is a small body of spongy tissue that is highly sexually sensitive. Only the tip or glans of the clitoris shows extrernally, but the organ itself is elongated and branched into two forks, the crura, which extend downward along the rim of the vaginal opening toward the perineum. Thus the clitoris is much larger than most people think it is -- about 4"" long, on average. The clitoral glans or external tip of the cltoris is protected by the prepuce, or clitoral hood, a covering of tissue similar to the foreskin of the male penis. During sexual excitement, the clitoris may extend and the hood retract to make the clitoral glans more accessible. 
	
***Labia Minora***

The labia minora are the inner lips of the vulva, thin stretches of tissue within the labia majora that fold and protect the vagina, urethra, and clitoris. The appearance of labia minora can vary widely, from tiny lips that hide between the labia majora to large lips that protrude. The most common metaphor for the labia minora is that of a flower. Both the inner and outer labia are quite sensitive to touch and pressure. 

***Labia Majora***

The labia majora are the outer lips of the vulva, pads of fatty tissue that wrap around the vulva from the mons to the perineum. These labia are usually covered with pubic hair, and contain numerous sweat and oil glands, and it has been suggested that the scent from these are sexually arousing. 
	
	
***Vagina***
The vagina extends from the vaginal opening to the cervix, the opening to the uterus. The vagina serves as the receptacle for the penis during sexual intercourse, and as the birth canal through which the baby passes during labor. The average vaginal canal is three inches long, possibly four in women who have given birth. This may seem short in relation to the penis, but during sexual arousal the cervix will lift upwards and the fornix may extend upwards into the body as long as necessary to receive the penis. After intercourse, the contraction of the vagina will allow the cervix to rest inside the fornix, which in its relaxed state is a bowl-shaped fitting perfect for the pooling of semen. At either side of the vaginal opening are the Bartholin's glands, which produce small amounts of lubricating fluid, apparently to keep the inner labia moist during periods of sexual excitement. Further within are the hymen glands, which secrete lubricant for the length of the vaginal canal. ",0,0
11,Everything about the penis†,"Men are competitive when it comes to their ability to satisfy women, and unfortunately after years of locker-room comparisons, the go-to source of pride or shame is the size of that with which they're working. 

A non-erect penis usually measures between 8.5cm and 10.5cm (3-4 inches) from tip to base. The average figure is about 9.5cm (3.75 inches), but this kind of precise measurement is rather valueless. Great majority of penises measure between 15cm and 18cm (6-7 inches) when erect, with the average figure being about 16.5cm (6.5 inches).So you can see that even if a man has got a 'small' penis, he's got a built-in compensating factor that will bring him up to about the same size as the guy who appears to be 'better equipped' in the shower room. If you're really worried that your penis is the wrong size, go and see your doctor. Their also various methods that are so widely advertised to the public can be summed up as follows.

* Pills or patches for increasing penis size
* enlargement surgery
* enlargement exercices
* suction devices

Several European experts say that the relatively new stretcher or extender devices may sometimes be of value in giving a man a little extra length.

11,Everything about the Erections ,"***Erectile dysfunction***
 
Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as impotence, is the inability to achieve or sustain an erection for satisfactory sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction is different from other conditions that interfere with male sexual intercourse, such as lack of sexual desire and problems with ejaculation and orgasm. In older men, ED usually has a physical cause, such as disease, injury, or side effects of drugs. Any disorder that causes injury to the nerves or impairs blood flow in the penis has the potential to cause ED. ED is treatable at any age, and awareness of this fact has been growing. More men have been seeking help and returning to normal sexual activity because of improved, successful treatments for ED.


***Priapism***
 
Priapism is a prolonged painful erection, lasting more than four hours, that does not result from sexual desire and does not subside despite orgasm. Normally, blood enters the erectile tissues of the penis and forms an erection which subsides with an orgasm.  It is either due to too much blood flowing into the erectile tissues of the penis (high flow state priapism), or from blood not leaving the corpora fast enough (low flow state priapism). High flow state is usually associated with trauma. 
Long-lasting (greater than 4 hours), ischemic erections, known as low flow priapism, usually consist of a painful erection, due to the lack of oxygen to the penis. This problem is a medical emergency condition and should be treated within a short period of time. The condition known as high flow priapism is characterized by a constant, painless erection. This is not a medical emergency, but requires medical attention nonetheless. 


***Impotence***

Loss of sex drive and impotence are very common in men and women as they age, and talking with your doctor can alleviate fears, as there are many treatment options. Stress is a key factor in one's sexual health. The simple act of fearing that you may not be able to get an erection can in itself cause erectile dysfunction. There are two facets to maintaining an erection, one is physical, and one is mental. When partners are on the opposite end of the libido scale, it is important to communicate and find ways to pleasure each other when intercourse is not possible.",0,1
11,Circumcision  or not†?,"Boys are born with a hood of skin, called the foreskin, covering the head (also called the glans) of the penis. In circumcision, the foreskin is surgically removed, exposing the end of the penis. circumcision often do so based on religious beliefs, concerns about hygiene, or cultural or social reasons, such as the wish to have their son look like other men in the family. Penile problems, such as irritation, inflammation, and infection, are more common in uncircumcised males. It's easier to keep a circumcised penis clean, although uncircumcised boys can learn how to clean beneath the foreskin once the foreskin becomes retractable.

Some people claim that circumcision either lessens or heightens the sensitivity of the tip of the penis, decreasing or increasing sexual pleasure later in life. But neither of these subjective findings has been proved. Although circumcision appears to have some medical benefits, it also carries potential risks ó as does any surgical procedure. These risks are small, but you should be aware of both the possible advantages and the problems before you make your decision.

11,Everything about the Ejaculation,"***Ejaculation***

Is the ejecting of semen (usually carrying sperm) from the male reproductory tract, and is usually accompanied by orgasm.Ejaculation takes place in two stages.

First stage: The first stage is called emission (which means ""the act of sending or throwing something out"")

Second stage: Ejaculation proper. The second stage is called ejaculation proper (which means ""real ejaculation""). When ejaculation proper begins, the man starts having an orgasm.

Normally, an ejaculation makes between 2and 6 milliliters (up to one teaspoonful) of semen. The number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things. There may be more sperm if: the man is younger, his body produces more of the hormone testosterone, which makes a person look and feel like a man, his testicles are not too warm, he has not ejaculated for some time, and he has been stimulated for a longer time before ejaculation.


***Premature Ejaculation***

Defined as ejaculating before either partner achieves satisfaction, premature ejaculation is one of the most common complaints affecting most men from time to time. It often occurs early in relationships when sexual excitement, some anxiety and over stimulation are common features. It is also more common in younger men who are finding out about sexual activity and sexual relationships and men of all ages after a long period without sex. Premature ejaculation is rarely caused by any underlying disease, structural or physical problems. Remember getting good at sex and overcoming premature ejaculation can take a bit of time. Practice makes perfect. If you find that things are not improving then help is available from sex therapists who are experts in this field.


***Sperms***

A sperm is a very tiny male sex cell. Under a microscope, sperm look just like tadpoles. 
Quantity-Most men release about one teaspoon of fluid when ejaculating. Genetics play a major role in how much a man produces. And, how frequently he can ejaculate. 
Color-The color is generally a pearly white. But, it can also be grayish or yellowish to yellow. 
Taste and Smell-The taste and smell can vary a lot from man to man. It is affected by general health, medication, and often by what you eat. ",0,1
11,The male G-spot,"
The process of prostate milking, otherwise known as stimulating the male G-spot, is one that can potentially lead to the ultimate male orgasm. Knowing where to find the male G-spot and properly stimulating it are the keys to unlocking the most electrifying sexual experience a man could have. The male G-spot can be used to heighten sexual intercourse or as a form of masturbation. The male G-spot is actually a man's prostate, the gland responsible for producing semen. 

It is located below the bladder and in front of the rectum; it is a bump about the size of a chestnut.To locate the male G-spot ,Gently insert your finger into your anus and probe slowly. You will know you've reached the prostate gland when you come across the chestnut-size bump that is roughly 2 inches inward.",0,1
11,The female G-spot,"The term ""G-Spot"" was coined after the German gynecologist Ernst Gr‰fenberg.The G spot is an area located a few inches up inside the vagina near a woman's stomach. Glands located in this area produce a watery substance which is expelled during female ejaculation. The tissue surrounding these glands swells with blood during sexual arousal producing an orgasm different from those produced by clitoral stimulation.

To Find your G spot, Place your palm face down on your vulva and insert a finger inside your vagina bending it forward and pressing upward. It's important to use firm pressure when trying to locate your G spot. About 2 inches up you should feel a bump or ridged area on the upper wall of your vagina. This area is usually only about 1 inch in diameter. When you stimulate your G spot it will produce a very strong sensation.",0,1
